 * Available player actions.

 * A player can not perform any new action, if during last {@code game.actionDetectionInterval - 1} game ticks he
 * already performed maximum possible actions. At the start of the game this limit is {@code game.baseActionCount} for
 * each player. The limit increases for each captured control center.
 * <p>
 * The most actions require additional parameters to perform. The strategy can set up an action with parameters updating
 * fields of a {@code move} object. If the specified parameters are incorrect or not sufficient, the action will be
 * ignored by game simulator. However, each action that is specified and is not {@code NONE} counts in the list of last
 * actions.
